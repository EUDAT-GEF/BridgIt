    <text>EU authorities in Brussels have called for a reform of European asylum rules to ease the strain on countries such as Greece and Italy that are struggling to cope with a large influx of people.

About 1.1 million migrants and refugees arrived in the EU last year, bringing the blocâs common asylum system to the brink of collapse.
